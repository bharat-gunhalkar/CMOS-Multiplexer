# CMOS-Multiplexer
Using a 2:1 Multiplexer to implement a 4:1 Multiplexer. Both Complementary Logic and Dynamic Logic are accomplished using Cadence software. When comparing the parameters Rise Time, Fall Time, Area, and Power Consumption, the findings from transient analysis in Cadence reveal that the Dynamic Logic outperforms the Complementary Logic.
